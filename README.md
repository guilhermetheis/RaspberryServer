# RaspberryServer

This repository serves as a Raspberry Pi Server. The final product of this is having a single Pi or several easy to reproduce ones to handle other electronics systems in my house. From SDRs to sensor networks.

## Objective

This project is used to learn and improve programming and electronics. Everything should be documented throughly and for this [Shpinx](https://github.com/guilhermetheis/RaspberryServer.git). 

## Documentation

The code doesn't need to be documented necessarly, however steps/research should be. For this Sphinx and [Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html) seems interesting.

## First requirements

- [ ] Establish Rasp as server[^1]
- [ ] Create documentation files and structure

[^1]: Should be able to use with windows, UNIX and standalone. Also should be able to handle different task (i.e: getting info from SDR and sensor network)
